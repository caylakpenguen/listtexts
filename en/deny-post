%wrap%Hi, this is the Mlmmj program managing the $listaddr$ mailing list.

%wrap%The message from $posteraddr$ with subject "$subject" was unable
to be delivered to the list
%ifreason maxmailsize%
  because it exceeded the maximum allowed message size of $maxmailsize$
  bytes.
%endif%
%ifreason tocc%
  because the list address was not found in either the To: or CC: header.
%endif%
%ifreason access%
  because of an access rule set up by the list administrator.
%endif%
%ifreason reject%
  because a moderator rejected it.
%endif%
%ifreason subonlypost%
  because you are not a list subscriber.

  %ifncontrol closedlist%%ifncontrol closedlistsub%
    However, this is an open list. If you wish, you can simultaneously
    subscribe and release your post by sending a message to
    $listsubreleaseaddr$ which can usually be done simply by replying to
    this message. The subject and the body of the message can be anything.
    %ifncontrol nodigestsub%

%wrap%
      Or you can simultaneously subscribe to the digest version of the list
      and release your post by sending a message to $nomailsubreleaseaddr$
      and you will receive multiple posts in a single message, at regular
      intervals, or when a lot of posts have accumulated.
    %endif%
    %ifncontrol nonomailsub%

%wrap%
      Or you can simultaneously subscribe to the no-mail version of the list
      and release your post by sending a message to $nomailsubreleaseaddr$
      and you will not receive posts sent to the list. This means you
      potentially will not see replies to your message, unless you follow
      the list using a web archive or have another email address subscribed
      to another version of the list.

  %ifcontrol closedlist closedlistsub%
    If you wish to become a subscriber, you will need to contact a list
    administrator. You can email $listowner$ to contact the list owner.
  %endif%

%wrap%
  If you believe you are a subscriber, you are probably subscribed with a
  different email address. To find out which address you are subscribed
  with, refer to the message welcoming you to the list, or look at the
  envelope "Return-Path" header of a message you receive from the list.
