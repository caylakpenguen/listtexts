%wrap%Hi, this is the Mlmmj program managing the $listaddr$ mailing list.

%wrap%The message from $posteraddr$ with subject "$subject$" has been
submitted to the list. However, the moderators are being asked to review it
before releasing it to the list
%ifreason moderated%
because this is a moderated list.
%endif%
%ifreason access%
because of an access rule.
%endif%
%ifreason modnonsubposts%
because you are not a subscriber.
  %ifncontrol closedlist%%ifncontrol closedlistsub%

    However, this is an open list. If you wish, you can simultaneously
    subscribe and release your post by sending a message to
    $listsubreleaseaddr$ which can usually be done simply by replying to
    this message. The subject and the body of the message can be anything.

%wrap%
      Or you can simultaneously subscribe to the digest version of the list
      and release your post by sending a message to $nomailsubreleaseaddr$
      and you will receive multiple posts in a single message, at regular
      intervals, or when a lot of posts have accumulated.
    %endif%
    %ifncontrol nonomailsub%

%wrap%
      Or you can simultaneously subscribe to the no-mail version of the list
